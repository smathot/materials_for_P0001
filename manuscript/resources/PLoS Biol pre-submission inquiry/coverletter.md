Dear Editor,

We would like to submit a pre-submission inquiry regarding the suitability of our manuscript, entitled *The Pupillary Light Response Reflects Eye-Movement Preparation*, for publication in *PLoS Biology*.

In this manuscript, we show that the eye's pupil prepares a constriction (or dilation) just before  an eye movement brings a bright (or dark) stimulus into central vision. This striking and previously unreported finding shows that the pupillary response to light is not a 'simple' reflex, but is intricately related to visual attention and eye-movement preparation. Our finding contrasts with the traditional assumption that the pupillary light response is a low-level reflex to the amount of light that falls on the retina, and is consistent with recent studies that have demonstrated a variety of high-level cognitive influences on the light response [@Mathôt2013Plos;@Binda2013JNeurosci;@Laeng2012Proceed].

In our experiment, healthy human participants fixated a central gray area and made a saccadic eye movement towards a peripheral target. Using gaze-contingent display changes, we manipulated whether or not the brightness of the target was the same during and after eye-movement preparation. More specifically, on some trials we changed the brightness of the target as soon as the eyes set in motion, thus dissociating the preparatory PLR (i.e. to the target brightness during saccade preparation) from the 'regular' PLR (i.e. to the target brightness after the saccade). We show that a preparatory PLR is initiated during saccade preparation, approximately 100 ms before the eyes set in motion. We believe that this preparatory response is functionally significant, because it allows the (relatively sluggish) pupil to keep up with the rapid changes in input brightness that occur as a result of our eye movements.

Because pupillometry is extensively used in a wide variety of settings (e.g., in experimental psychology [@Laeng2012Window], for diagnostic purposes [@Kardon1992], and for brain-computer interfaces [@Stoll2013]), we believe that *PLoS Biology*, with its broad audience, would be the ideal outlet for our research, which highlights a fundamental new property of the pupillary response.

Thank you in advance for considering our pre-submission inquiry.

Kindest regards,
