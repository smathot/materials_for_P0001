You need light in order to see. The more light enters the eye, the easier it is to distinguish visual signal from the intrinsic neural noise of the visual system [e.g., @BurnsBaylor2001]. Therefore, pupillary dilation improves the signal-to-noise ratio of vision, and consequently improves visual acuity, by increasing the amount of light that enters the eye. However, large pupils can also be disadvantageous, because various optical distortions are most pronounced when a large surface of the eye's lens is exposed [@Denton1956; @Campbell1960]. The optimal size of the pupil therefore depends on how much light is available. In darkness, visual acuity is limited by the scarcity of light, and the pupil dilates to increase light influx. In brightness, even a small pupil lets through sufficient light, and the pupil constricts to reduce optical abberations. Among other things, the pupillary light response (PLR) is therefore a mechanism to optimize visual acuity under varying levels of ambient lighting.

However, the presumed function of the PLR would seem at odds with its relatively high latency, which ranges from 250 to 500 ms [@Ellis1981]. Given that we make three to four eye movements per second [@Rayner1998], the PLR would therefore seem to lag behind: When you make an eye movement towards a bright object, your pupil would constrict only after your gaze has already shifted elsewhere.

Here we test the hypothesis that preparation is an important characteristic of the PLR: When you prepare a saccadic eye movement towards a stimulus, a PLR to that stimulus' brightness is prepared before the eyes actually set in motion, during the preparation of the saccade itself. This would allow the PLR to rapidly track changes in the brightness of visual input, despite being a relatively slow response.

There are two main findings that support this hypothesis. Firstly, every saccade is preceded by a covert shift of attention [@Deubel1996Common; @Kowler1995]: If you prepare a saccade towards a stimulus, you will start to perceive that stimulus more clearly sometime before the saccade is executed. Secondly, we and others have recently shown that a PLR is elicited by a covert shift of attention [@Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc]. In our experiment, participants fixated on the center of a display that was divided into a bright and a dark half [@Mathôt2013Plos]. Participants identified a target stimulus that was presented on the bright or dark background. The target's probable location was indicated by a cue, which induced a covert shift of attention to the cued side. Crucially, the pupil constricted when attention was directed to the bright, as compared to the dark side of the display. This showed that a PLR is elicited by a covertly attended stimulus, even when eye position and visual input are controlled for.

In sum, saccadic eye movements are preceded by covert shifts of attention [@Kowler1995;@Deubel1996Common], and covert shifts of attention elicit a PLR [@Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc]. Here combine these findings and test whether the preparation of a saccade towards a bright (or dark) stimulus triggers the preparation of a PLR.
