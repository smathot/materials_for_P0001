You need light in order to see. The more light enters the eye, the easier it is to distinguish visual signal from the intrinsic neural noise of the visual system [e.g., @BurnsBaylor2001]. Therefore, pupillary dilation improves the signal-to-noise ratio of vision--and consequently improves visual acuity--by increasing the amount of light that enters the eye.

However, there are also disadvantages to having large pupils. As first suggested by Denton [-@Denton1956], large pupils are detrimental to vision, because various optical distortions are most pronounced when a large surface of the eye's lens is exposed [see also @Campbell1960;@Woodhouse1975Grating]. The optimal pupil size therefore depends on the amount of light that is available. In darkness, visual acuity is mostly limited by the scarcity of the available light, and the pupil dilates to increase light influx. In brightness, there is light aplenty, and the pupil constricts to reduce the optical abberations that result from the imperfections of the eye's lens. Among other things [e.g., @WoodhouseCampbell1975], the pupillary light response (PLR) is therefore a mechanism to optimize visual acuity under varying levels of ambient lighting.

Given this presumed function, it is odd that the PLR is such a slow response. Numerous studies have shown that it takes at least 250 ms for the pupil to constrict after exposure to a bright stimulus. Depending on age and other factors this latency can even increase to up to 500 ms [@Ellis1981; @FeinbergPodolak1965]. Because humans make about three eye movements per second [@Rayner1998], the PLR would therefore seem to 'lag behind': When you make an eye movement towards a bright light, your pupil constricts only after your gaze has already shifted elsewhere.

So how can the PLR serve a useful purpose if it is too slow to keep up with your eye movements? One intriguing possibility is that the effective latency of the PLR is far lower than previous research has suggested. Much of our understanding of the PLR is based on passive-viewing studies, in which the pupillary response to a suddenly presented stimulus is recorded [e.g., @Ellis1981; @FeinbergPodolak1965; @Crawford1936; @Loewenfeld1958; and many more]. Passive viewing is an unnatural situation for our action-wired nervous system, because it decouples perception from action. Therefore, passive viewing is very different from real-life visual perception, in which what you see is largely a consequence of your own actions [i.e. 'active vision', cf. @FindlayGilchrist2003;@Mathôt2011Phil]. That is, you generally see a person because you have made an eye movement to bring that person into central vision, and not because that person has suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The same is true for the PLR: Although a PLR may occasionally be elicited by an unexpected stimulus, such as a light that is switched on, it will usually be the consequence of an eye movement towards a bright stimulus. Strikingly, the PLR in the context of self-generated movement has so far received little attention.

Here we test the hypothesis that the PLR is, at least in part, an anticipatory response: As soon as you prepare an eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, a PLR is prepared as well--already before the eyes actually set in motion. Given the traditional assumption that the PLR is a low-level reflex to light, the suggestion that this response may be elicited by anticipation, and thus in the absence of direct stimulation, seems implausible. However, there are two main findings that support this prediction very strongly.

Firstly, every saccadic eye movement is preceded by a covert shift of attention [@Deubel1996Common; @Kowler1995]. The time course of this pre-saccadic shift of attention has recently been mapped out by Rolfs and Carrasco [-@RolfsCarrasco2012]. In their experiment, the primary task of the participant was to make a saccadic eye movement towards a target. Just before or after the eyes set in motion, a slightly tilted Gabor patch was briefly presented at the saccade target. The secondary task of the participant was to indicate the orientation and contrast of this Gabor patch, relative to a reference stimulus. This secondary task provided a measure of discrimination performance and visual sensitivity, two hallmarks of attention [@CarrascoLing2004;@Posner1980Orient]. Rolfs and Carrasco's [-@RolfsCarrasco2012] crucial finding was that discrimination performance as well as perceived contrast gradually increased at the saccade target from about 100 ms prior to the onset of the saccade [see also @Deubel2008Time].

Secondly, we and others have recently shown that the PLR can be elicited by a covert shift of attention [@Binda2013Bright; @Mathôt2013Plos]. In our experiment, which was a variation of the classic Posner cueing paradigm [@Posner1980Orient], participants fixated on the center of a display that was divided into a bright and a dark half, separated by a central gray band. Participants identified a target stimulus, which was presented on the left or right side of the display, on a bright or dark background. Just before the target appeared, its probable location was indicated by a cue. Participants covertly shifted their attention to the cued side, in anticipation of the target. Crucially, the pupil constricted when participants covertly attended to the bright side of the display, relative to when they attended to the dark side. This showed that a PLR is elicited by covertly attending to a bright object, even when eye position is controlled and visual input is kept constant.

In sum, eye movements are preceded by a covert shift of attention [@Kowler1995;@Deubel1996Common], and a covert shift of attention elicits a PLR [@Mathôt2013Plos;@Binda2013Bright]. Together, these findings suggest that when you make an eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, the pre-saccadic shift of attention should elicit a PLR already before the eyes set in motion. Given the time course of the pre-saccadic shift of attention, which precedes eye movements by 100 ms [@RolfsCarrasco2012;@Deubel2008Time], we can be even more explicit about our prediction: The latency of the PLR should be reduced by approximately 100 ms, relative to a passive-viewing condition.

In the present experiment, participants made a saccadic eye movement from a central fixation dot towards a small target on the left or right side of the display. After the eye movement, the background of the target was always either bright or dark. In all conditions, we therefore expected a robust PLR, reflected by a relative constriction to brightness, and a relative dilation to darkness. Crucially, our experimental conditions differed in the structure of the display before the eye movement. In the Onset condition, the target background was initially gray and turned dark/ bright as soon as the eyes set in motion (%FigParadigm::c). This condition was analogous to passive viewing in the sense that the target luminance could not be anticipated. In the Constant condition, the target background was dark/ bright from the start of the trial (%FigParadigm::a), and could therefore be anticipated during eye-movement preparation. Therefore, we expected the latency of the PLR to be reduced in the Constant condition, relative to the Onset condition. Finally, in the Swap condition, the brightness of the target background reversed polarity when the eyes set in motion: Bright became dark and dark became bright (%FigParadigm::b). Here we expected that the PLR would initially reflect the target brightness as it was during the preparation (but before the onset) of the eye movement. We expected that this anticipatory PLR would be followed by a 'normal' PLR to the post-saccadic brightness of the target.
