## The effect of eye-movement preparation on the PLR

Pupil size depends on numerous factors [see @Laeng2012Preconscious for a review], but here we focus on the effect of target-background luminance within conditions (i.e. the PLR). The PLR corresponds to a negativity in %FigMain::a, and a constriction on Land-on-Bright trials, relative to Land-on-Dark trials in %FigMain::b,c,d. The interval up to 220 ms after the display change is crucial, because we predicted a luminance effect during this interval if, and only if, preparation was possible.

  a) Mean difference in pupil size between Land-on-Bright and Land-on-Dark trials for the three conditions as a function of time relative to display change. The PLR is shown as a negativity. The dot-dashed line shows the 'flipped' Swap condition, and is shown for comparison with the Constant condition. b, c, d) Mean pupil size on Land-on-Dark and Land-on-Bright trials over time for the Constant (b), Swap (c), and Onset (d) conditions. The PLR is shown as a decreased pupil size on Land-on-Bright trials, relative to Land-on-Dark trials. Line widths indicate mean ± standard error. Background shadings indicate significant divergence between Land-on-Dark and Land-on-Bright trials (t > 2 for at least 200 consecutive samples). Inset panels zoom in on the -50 to +50 ms interval. Inset example displays schematically illustrate trial progression. a, b, c, d) The vertical dotted lines correspond to mean saccade onset (left-most) and offset (right-most). The surrounding shadings indicate the full range of observed values. The display change (or a dummy change in the Constant condition) occurred at time 0, indicated by the dashed vertical line.

To determine the earliest effects of luminance on pupil size, we conducted linear mixed-effects (LME) analyses with Participant as random effect on the intercept, Target Luminance (post-saccadic; Land-on-Dark or Land-on-Bright) as fixed effect, and Pupil Size as dependent measure. This analysis was performed separately for each time point and condition. We considered divergence between Land-on-Dark and Land-on-Bright trials to be significant when t > 2 [cf. @Baayen2008Mixed] for at least 200 consecutive samples [cf. @Mathôt2013Plos].

The effect of eye-movement preparation on the PLR was evident in two main ways. Firstly, in the Constant condition, divergence occurred already during the saccade, before the eyes had landed (from -9 ms until trial end; values relative to display change at time 0; see small inset panel in %FigMain::b). This extremely rapid modulation of pupil size clearly shows that a PLR was prepared before saccade onset. As expected, divergence was observed much later in the Onset condition (+283 ms until trial end), in which preparation was not possible.

Secondly, in the Swap condition there was initially a (seemingly) inverse PLR, again arising during the saccade (-3 ms until +417 ms; see small inset panel in %FigMain::c). Strikingly, the (flipped) Swap condition was qualitatively indistinguishable from the Constant condition until about 250 ms after the saccade (compare the dot-dashed and solid lines in %FigMain::a). This suggests that it takes about 250 ms for the pupil to respond to the post-saccadic luminance, consistent with previous estimates of the PLR latency [e.g., @Ellis1981;@WangMunoz2014]. From about 600 ms onwards the Swap condition was qualitatively indistinguishable from the Onset condition (compare the dashed and dotted lines in %FigMain::a), suggesting that by this time the preparatory component of the PLR had fully dissipated.

Finally, there was a slight pupillary dilation during the saccade, which is clearly visible in the inset panels of %FigMain::b,c,d. The origin of this intra-saccadic dilation is not clear. One possibility is that the physical forces that operate on the eye during a saccade cause a slight distortion of the iris' shape, which could be (artifactually) recorded as a dilation by the eye tracker [for a related technical point, see @NystrHoogeHolmqvist2013]. We note this effect for completeness only, as it is not specific to our experiment.

## Modeling the PLR

A visual inspection of %FigMain::a suggests that preparation qualitatively alters the shape of the PLR, rather than merely reduces its latency. More specifically, in the Constant condition, the PLR appeared to consist of a small, but rapidly developing bias that emerged already before the eyes landed (see the inset panel in %FigMain::b). This initial bias was followed by a much more pronounced response, which we will call the 'full PLR'. We created two models to investigate whether the effect of preparation is limited to this initial bias, or whether the latency of the full PLR is reduced as well.

First, we modeled only the 0 - 220 ms interval, which we had defined as reflecting purely preparatory activity (%FigFit::a). For each participant separately, we fitted a linear function to the mean difference response in the three conditions. To allow for direct comparison with the Constant condition, we 'flipped' the Swap condition. Next, we used paired-samples *t* tests to test for differences in slope and intercept, using a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level of .0083 (= .05 / 6 comparisons). This showed that the slope was lower (i.e. more negative) in the Constant (t(7) = 5.19, p = .0013) and Swap (t(7) = 3.87, p = .0061) conditions than in the Onset condition, whereas there was no significant difference between the Constant and Swap conditions (t(7) = 1.23, p = .2581). The comparisons for the intercept showed the same qualitative pattern, but were less reliable (Constant vs Onset: t(7) = 2.69, p = .0310; Swap vs Onset: t(7) = 1.66, p = .1396; Constant vs Swap: t(7) = 0.34, p = .7460). In sum, a linear model of the 0 - 220 ms interval revealed a rapidly developing PLR if, and only if, preparation was possible.

Dotted lines indicate linear-model fits. b) The exponential-decay function used to model pupil-size difference (`p(t)`) as a function of time since display change (`t`) during the 0 - 2000 ms interval. This function has four free parameters: full PLR latency (`t0`), initial pupil-size difference (`p1`), final pupil-size difference (`p2`), and response speed (the inverse of `s`). c) Observed difference in pupil size between Land-on-Bright and Land-on-Dark trials and model fits (dotted lines) for the Constant and Onset conditions (solid and dashed lines, respectively). Vertical lines indicate full PLR latencies (`t0`) for the Constant (solid) and Onset (dashed) conditions. The left pane depicts the grand mean response. The eight rightward panes show the mean responses for each of the eight participants.

Next, we modeled a longer interval (0 - 2000 ms). We acknowledge that not all effects observed during this interval necessarily reflect preparatory activity, but we nevertheless feel that modeling a longer interval is informative. We chose an exponential-decay function, adapted from @HoeksLevelt1993, which models the difference in pupil size between Land-on-Bright and Land-on-Dark trials (`p(t)`) as a function of time since display change (`t`; see %FigFit::b). There are several other functions that fit the PLR about equally well, but the advantage of exponential decay is that its parameters have clear interpretations: full PLR latency (`t0`), initial pupil-size difference (`p1`), final pupil-size difference (`p2`), and response speed (the inverse of `s`; a low `s` corresponds to a rapid decline). ++(The exponential-decay model assumes that pupil size is constant before `t0`. However, %FigFit::a shows that preparation triggers slight pupil-size changes already before `t0`, although these are an order of a magnitude smaller than the 'full PLR' that arises later. It will be an important challenge for future research to improve models of the PLR to fully account for the effects of attention and eye-movement preparation.)++

Because the Swap condition is a combination of two opposite responses (to the pre- and post-saccadic brightness of the target, see %FigMain::c), it is not properly modeled in a way that allows for direct comparison with the other conditions. Therefore, we modeled only the Constant and Onset conditions here. ++(See the Supplementary Materials for a model of the swap condition.)++

We determined the model parameters for each participant, and tested for differences using a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level of .0125 (= .05 / 4 comparisons). Crucially, full PLR latency (`t0`) was 107 ms lower on Constant trials (M = 268, SE = 16.0) than on Onset trials (M = 375, SE = 16.6, t(7) = 9.33, p < .0001). In addition, initial pupil-size difference (`p1`) was slightly smaller (i.e. more negative) on Constant than on Onset trials (t(7) = 4.17, p = .0042), as was final pupil-size difference (t(7) = 3.56, p = .0093). Response speed was slightly higher (i.e. a lower `s`, corresponding to a more rapidly declining function) in the Constant condition than in the Onset condition, but this difference was not reliable (t(7) = 2.295, p = .0554). In sum, the exponential-decay model confirms and extends the LME analyses by showing that preparation both induces an initial bias (`p1`) and reduces the latency of the PLR (`t0`).

## Accounting for gaze bias prior to saccade onset

When you attend to a stimulus without looking directly at it (i.e. covert attention), fixational eye movements tend to gravitate towards the attended stimulus [@Engbert2003]. Therefore, in our experiment, fixational eye movements could bring the eyes slightly closer to the (attended) saccade target already before the eyes set in motion. To control for this, we eliminated gaze bias through a pairwise-matching algorithm [cf. @Mathôt2013Plos]. First, we determined the mean horizontal gaze deviation towards the cued side during the pre-saccade epoch for every trial. Next, we created pairs of trials with an opposite, but approximately equal bias (i.e. the summed bias was less than 0.03°). All trials that could not be paired were discarded (17.45%). This left a subset of trials in which there was no horizontal gaze bias (mean bias < .01°). The analyses described above were re-run on this subset of trials. This revealed virtually identical results to the full analysis (not shown; figures included in on-line supplementary analyses). However, it is worth mentioning that divergence in the Constant condition was observed even earlier in this analysis (from -105 ms until trial end). Crucially, this illustrates that our results are not due to a gaze-position bias prior to the eye movement, and demonstrates the robustness of the results.
