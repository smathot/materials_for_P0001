# Abstract

When the eyes are exposed to an increased influx of light, the pupils constrict. The pupillary light response (PLR) is traditionally believed to be purely reflexive and not susceptible to cognitive influences. Here we report that the PLR is initiated during the preparation of an eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, even before the eyes set in motion. Healthy human participants fixated a central gray area and made a saccadic eye movement towards a peripheral target. Using gaze-contingent display changes, we manipulated whether or not the brightness of the target could be anticipated during eye-movement preparation. We show that, if anticipation is possible, a PLR is initiated approximately 100 ms before the eyes set in motion. This allows the pupil to track luminance changes in visual input more rapidly than would be possible without anticipation. Strikingly, a purely anticipatory luminance-related pupillary response is triggered even when an eye movement is prepared towards a bright (or dark) stimulus that is removed before being brought into central vision. We link our findings to the pre-saccadic shift of attention: The pupil adjusts its size to the brightness of a to-be-fixated stimulus, as soon as attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming saccade. Our findings illustrate that the PLR is a dynamic movement that is tightly linked to visual attention and eye-movement preparation.
