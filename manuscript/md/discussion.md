Here we report, for the first time, that the pupillary light response (PLR) is partly preparatory. When you prepare a saccadic eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, the pupil prepares to adjust its size to the impending luminance change already before the eyes set in motion. This finding contrasts with the traditional view that the PLR is a low-level reflex to light, and shows that the PLR is tightly linked to visual attention and eye movements [see also @Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc].

The effect of preparation on the PLR is twofold. Firstly, when preparation was possible, pupil size was affected by the luminance of a to-be-fixated surface even before the eyes had landed (%FigMain::b). Given that it takes 220 - 500 ms for the pupil to respond to luminance changes [@Ellis1981;@WangMunoz2014], this initial response must result from preparation. Strikingly, we could 'trick' the pupil into preparing for a luminance that was never brought into central vision, by changing the display brightness during the saccade (%FigMain::c). This again suggests that the PLR has a preparatory component.

We created two models to obtain a qualitative picture of how the PLR is affected by preparation. First, we focused on the 0 - 220 ms interval, which we had defined as reflecting purely preparatory activity (%FigFit::a). A linear model of this interval revealed that preparation triggered a weak, but rapidly developing PLR, which started already before the eyes had landed. Next, we created an exponential-decay model of the 0 - 2000 ms interval. This revealed that the rapid initial build-up was followed by a much more pronounced response, which we have called the 'full PLR' (%FigFit::c). Because the full PLR occurs quite late, it is difficult to attribute differences in its latency unambiguously to eye-movement preparation. However, it is suggestive that the full PLR occurred 100 ms earlier when preparation was possible, relative to when it was not. This latency reduction closely matches the finding that a covert shift of attention precedes every saccade by approximately 100 ms [@Deubel2008Time;@RolfsCarrasco2012]. Therefore, we suggest that the preparatory PLR is driven by the pre-saccadic shift of attention.

Our results complement recent studies that have demonstrated high-level effects on the PLR. Most relevant here is the recent finding that the PLR is modulated by covert visual attention [@Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc]: Merely attending to a bright stimulus from the corner of your eye triggers a pupillary constriction. Another striking result, which dates back almost a century, but has recently been re-discovered, comes from binocular rivalry. In these studies, stimuli of different brightness are presented to each eye [e.g., @Fahle2011;@Harms1937;@Naber2011]. The crucial finding is that the pupil constricts when the brighter stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when the darker stimulus dominates. This shows that the PLR reflects visual awareness, rather than objective luminance. A related finding is that the pupil constricts when viewing images that are interpreted as very bright, such as pictures of the sun, compared to equiluminant control images [@Binda2013Sun;@Naber2013Content;@LaengEndestad2012]. Finally, and perhaps most strikingly, merely thinking about a bright stimulus induces a pupillary constriction [@Laeng2014Imaginary]. Taken together, these very different studies converge on a very similar conclusion: The PLR is not just a reflexive response to light, but reflects what we (covertly) attend to, what we are aware of, how we interpret visual input, and even what we think about. Our study complements these findings by showing that the PLR is linked to saccade preparation. Functionally, the preparatory PLR may allow the visual system to track the rapid changes in input brightness that result from saccadic eye movements.

In conclusion, we have shown that the pupil prepares for the brightness of stimuli before they are brought into central vision. We have suggested that this finding is linked to the pre-saccadic shift of attention [@Deubel1996Common;@Kowler1995]: The pupil prepares a light response as soon as attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming saccadic eye movement.
