Here we report, for the first time, that the pupillary light response (PLR) is partly preparatory. When you prepare a saccadic eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, the pupil prepares to adjust its size to the impending luminance change already before the eyes set in motion. This finding contrasts with the traditional view that the PLR is a low-level reflex to light, and shows that the PLR is tightly linked to visual attention and eye movements [see also @Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc;@Daniels2012].

Preparation has two more-or-less distinct effects on the PLR. Firstly, when preparation was possible, we observed that pupil size was affected almost instantaneously by the luminance of a newly fixated surface, within 50 ms after saccade offset (%FigMain::b). Given that it takes 250 to 500 ms for the pupil to respond to luminance changes [@Ellis1981], this initial response must result from preparation. This initial response, which is small, is followed some time later by a more much pronounced response, which we have called the 'full PLR'. Preparation reduces the latency of the full PLR by about 100 ms (based on model estimates of `t0`, shown in %FigFit). This latency reduction closely matches the finding that a covert shift of attention precedes every saccade by approximately 100 ms [@Deubel2008Time;@RolfsCarrasco2012]. We suggest that the pre-saccadic shift of attention drives the preparatory PLR: The pupil prepares to adjust its size at the moment that attention covertly shifts towards the target of an upcoming saccade.

Strikingly, our results suggest that a PLR is elicited even when you prepare a saccade towards a bright (or dark) stimulus that is changed before being brought into central vision. More specifically, in the Swap condition (%FigMain::c), the brightness of the display reversed polarity as soon as a saccade was detected. Consequently, when preparing a saccade towards a bright target, the eyes landed on a dark target, and vice versa. Our crucial finding is that the pupil initially responded to the pre-saccadic brightness of the target. Again, this initial response occurred almost immediately after the eye movement (±19 ms after saccade offset), suggesting that it is entirely preparatory.

Our results complement recent studies that have demonstrated high-level effects on the PLR. Most relevant here is the recent finding that the PLR is modulated by covert visual attention [@Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc]: Merely attending to a bright stimulus from the corner of your eye triggers a pupillary constriction. Another striking result, which dates back almost a century, but has recently been re-discovered, comes from binocular rivalry. In these studies, stimuli of different brightness are presented to each eye [@LoweOgle1966;@Fahle2011;@Naber2011;@Harms1937]. The crucial finding is that the pupil constricts when the brighter stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when the darker stimulus dominates. This shows that the PLR reflects visual awareness, rather than objective luminance. A related finding is that the pupil constricts when viewing images that are interpreted as very bright, such as pictures of the sun, compared to equiluminant control images [@Binda2013Sun;@Naber2013Content;@LaengEndestad2012]. Finally, and perhaps most strikingly, merely thinking about a bright stimulus induces a pupillary constriction [@Laeng2014Imaginary]. Taken together, these very different studies converge on a very similar conclusion: The PLR is not just a reflexive response to light, but reflects what we (covertly) attend to, what we are aware of, how we interpret visual input, and even what we think about. Our study complements these findings by showing that the PLR is linked to saccade preparation. Functionally, preparation may allow the PLR to track the rapid changes in input brightness that result from saccadic eye movements. 

It is an appealing conjecture that the time-course of the preparatory PLR mirrors that of pre-saccadic neural activity in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in both saccade generation [@Robinson1972] and pupillary responses [@Wang2012JNeurosci]. Many SC neurons exhibit a gradual build-up of activity that reflects the initial stage of saccade preparation [@Munoz1995]. This build-up activity may be related to the very early, small effect of luminance on pupil size that we observed here. Build-up activity is followed by a vigorous burst of neural activity. This burst is directly related to saccade execution, and may have triggered the 'full' preparatory PLR that we observed here. Although the link between our results and saccade-related SC activity is speculative, we believe that pupillometry is a powerful new tool to investigate the dynamics of saccade preparation.

In conclusion, we have shown that the pupillary light response (PLR) prepares for the brightness of stimuli before they are brought into central vision. We have suggested that this finding is linked to the pre-saccadic shift of attention [@Deubel1996Common;@Kowler1995]: The pupil prepares a light response as soon as attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming saccadic eye movement.
