Here we report, for the first time, that the pupillary light response (PLR) is anticipatory: When you prepare an eye movement towards a bright/ dark stimulus, a PLR is prepared before the stimulus is actually brought into central vision. This finding contrasts with the traditional view that the PLR is a low-level reflex to light, and shows that the PLR is tightly linked to visual attention and eye movements.

In our data, the anticipatory nature of the PLR is evident in three ways, Firstly, the latency of the PLR is reduced by 107 ms when making an eye movement towards a bright/ dark stimulus, relative to when a stimulus suddenly appears (%FigFit). This latency reduction matches the finding that a covert shift of attention precedes every eye movement by approximately 100 ms [@Deubel2008Time;@RolfsCarrasco2012], suggesting that this pre-saccadic shift of attention drives the PLR: A PLR is elicited at the moment that attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming eye movement.

Secondly, a PLR is elicited when you prepare an eye movement towards a bright/ dark stimulus, even when that stimulus is never actually brought into central vision. More specifically, in the Swap condition [%FigMain::c], the brightness of the display reversed polarity during the eye movement. Consequently, when preparing an eye movement towards a bright stimulus, the eyes actually landed on a dark stimulus, and vice versa. The crucial finding is that the pupil responds briefly to the pre-saccadic brightness of the target.

Thirdly, the PLR is qualitatively different during self-generated movement and passive viewing. In passive-viewing experiments, pupil size is entirely unaffected by a suddenly presented stimulus, until a PLR is elicited with a latency of 250 - 500 ,ms [e.g., @Ellis1981;@FeinbergPodolak1965;@Lowenstein1950]. We replicate this pattern, but--crucially--only in the Onset condition [%FigMain::a], in which no anticipation is possible. In the Swap and Constant conditions, a small change in pupil size is evident almost immediately after the eye movement, followed later in time by a much larger response, which we might call the 'real' PLR. This shows that during self-generated movement, the PLR is not a single all-or-nothing response, but is to some extent gradual. Again, this is reminiscent of the pre-saccadic shift of attention, which also arises gradually before the onset of an eye movement.

Our results complement recent studies that have demonstrated various high-level effects on the PLR. Most relevant are two recent studies, by Binda and colleagues [@Binda2013Bright] and ourselves [@Mathôt2013Plos], which have shown that the PLR is modulated by covert visual attention: Merely attending to a bright stimulus from the corner of your eye is sufficient to trigger a pupillary constriction. Another striking result, which dates back almost a century, but has recently been re-discovered, comes from binocular-rivalry studies. In these studies, two stimuli of different brightness are presented to each eye [@LoweOgle1966;@Fahle2011;@Naber2011;@Brenner1969;Bárány1948;Harms1937]. At any one time, only one stimulus is perceived, although visual awareness 'flips' back and forth between both eyes. With respect to the PLR, the crucial finding is that the pupil constricts when the brighter stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when the darker stimulus dominates. Finally, it has recently been shown that the pupil constricts when viewing images that are interpreted as being very bright, such as pictures of the sun, compared to equiluminant control images [@Binda2013Sun;@Naber2013Content;@LaengEndestad2012]. Taken together, these studies show that the PLR reflects what we (covertly) attend to, what we are aware of, and how we interpret visual input. Our study complements these findings by showing that the PLR anticipates the visual changes that eye movements bright about.

In conclusion, we have shown that the pupillary light response (PLR) is anticipatory, and responds to the brightness of stimuli before they are even brought into central vision. We have suggested that this finding is linked to the pre-saccadic of attention that precedes every eye movement by about 100 ms [@Deubel2008Time;@RolfsCarrasco2012]: The pupil starts to adjust its size as soon as attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming saccade.
