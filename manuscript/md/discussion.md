Here we report, for the first time, that the pupillary light response (PLR) anticipates saccadic eye movements: When you prepare an eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, the pupil already adjusts its size to the anticipated luminance change before the eyes set in motion. This finding contrasts with the traditional view that the PLR is a low-level reflex to light, and shows that the PLR is tightly linked to visual attention and eye movements [see also @Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos].

In our data, anticipation is evident in three ways. Firstly, the latency of the PLR is reduced by 107 ms when making an eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, relative to when a stimulus suddenly appears and no anticipation is possible (%FigFit). This latency reduction closely matches the finding that a covert shift of attention precedes every eye movement by approximately 100 ms [@Deubel2008Time;@RolfsCarrasco2012]. We suggest that this pre-saccadic shift of attention drives the anticipatory PLR: The pupil starts to adjust its size at the moment that attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming eye movement.

Secondly, a PLR is elicited when you prepare an eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, even when that stimulus is never actually brought into central vision. More specifically, in the Swap condition (%FigMain::c), the brightness of the display reversed polarity during the eye movement. Consequently, when preparing an eye movement towards a bright target, the eyes landed on a dark target, and vice versa. The crucial finding is that the pupil initially responded to the pre-saccadic brightness of the target. This initial response occurred almost immediately after the eye movement (±19 ms after saccade offset), which, given the relative high latency of the PLR [250 - 500 ms, cf. @Ellis1981], strongly suggests that it was anticipatory.

Thirdly, the PLR is qualitatively different during self-generated movement and passive viewing. In passive-viewing experiments, pupil size is initially unaffected by a suddenly presented stimulus, until a PLR is elicited with a latency of 250 - 500 ms [e.g., @Ellis1981;@FeinbergPodolak1965;@Lowenstein1950]: a ballistic, all-or-nothing response. We replicate this pattern, but--crucially--only in the Onset condition, in which no anticipation was possible (%FigMain::a). In the Swap and Constant conditions, an initial small change in pupil size gradually arises (i.e. a negative `p1` in our exponential-decay model), followed later by a much more pronounced response, which we might call the PLR proper (i.e. the response from `t0` onwards). This shows that during self-generated movement, the PLR is not an all-or-nothing response, but arises more-or-less gradually. Consequently, the distinction between initial pupil size (`p1`) and response latency (`t0`), imposed by our exponential-decay function, is somewhat artificial. An interesting avenue for future research would be to develop a model of the PLR that takes into account eye-movement preparation, possibly using a deconvolution method to trace back the source of the PLR to pre-saccadic 'attentional pulses' [cf. @Wierda2012;@Zylberberg2012Frontiers].

Our results complement recent studies that have demonstrated various high-level effects on the PLR. Most relevant here are two studies, by @Binda2013Bright and ourselves [@Mathôt2013Plos], which have shown that the PLR is modulated by covert visual attention: Merely attending to a bright stimulus from the corner of your eye is sufficient to trigger a pupillary constriction. Another striking result, which dates back almost a century, but has recently been re-discovered, comes from binocular rivalry. In these studies, stimuli of different brightness are presented to each eye [@LoweOgle1966;@Fahle2011;@Naber2011;@Brenner1969;@Bárány1948;@Harms1937]. At any one time, only one stimulus is perceived, although visual awareness regularly 'flips' back and forth between both eyes. With respect to the PLR, the crucial finding is that the pupil constricts when the brighter stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when the darker stimulus dominates. This shows that the PLR reflects visual awareness, rather than objective luminance. Finally, three recent studies have shown that the pupil constricts when viewing images that are interpreted as being very bright, such as pictures of the sun, compared to equiluminant control images [@Binda2013Sun;@Naber2013Content;@LaengEndestad2012]. Taken together, these studies show that the PLR is not just a reflexive response to light, but reflects what we (covertly) attend to, what we are aware of, and how we interpret visual input. Our study complements these findings by showing that the PLR anticipates the visual consequences of saccadic eye movements.

In conclusion, we have shown that the pupillary light response (PLR) is anticipatory, and responds to the brightness of stimuli before they are brought into central vision. We have suggested that this finding is linked to the pre-saccadic of attention [@Deubel1996Common;@Kowler1995]: The pupil starts to adjust its size as soon as attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming eye movement.
