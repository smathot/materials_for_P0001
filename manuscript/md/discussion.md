Here we report, for the first time, that the pupillary light response (PLR) is in part preparatory: When you prepare a saccadic eye movement towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, the pupil prepares to adjust its size to the impending luminance change already before the eyes set in motion. This finding contrasts with the traditional view that the PLR is a low-level reflex to light, and shows that the PLR is tightly linked to visual attention and eye movements [see also @Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc;@Daniels2012].

Preparation has two more-or-less distinct effects on the PLR. Firstly, when preparation was possible, we observed that pupil size was affected by the luminance of a newly fixated surface within 50 ms after saccade offset (%FigMain::b). Given that it takes 250 to 500 ms for the pupil to respond to luminance changes [@Ellis1980], this initial response is clearly due to preparation. This initial response, which is small, is followed some time later by a more much pronounced response, which we might the 'full' PLR. Preparation reduces the latency of the full PLR by about 100 ms (based on model estimates of `t0`, shown in %FigFit). This latency reduction closely matches the finding that a covert shift of attention precedes every saccade by approximately 100 ms [@Deubel2008Time;@RolfsCarrasco2012]. We suggest that this pre-saccadic shift of attention drives the preparatory PLR: The pupil prepares to adjust its size at the moment that attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming saccade.

The finding that the PLR reflects saccade preparation potentially has important implications for theories of visual attention and eye movements. It is a speculative, but intriguing conjecture that the time-course of the pre-saccadic shift of attention mirrors that of the preparatory PLR. More specifically, attention may start to shift towards the target of an upcoming saccade about 200 ms before saccade onset. This very early shift of attention may be weak, and drive the small effect of luminance on pupil size that arises almost immediately after a saccade. A much more pronounced shift of attention might occur about 100 ms before saccade onset. This pronounced shift of attention would lead to increased perception of the saccade target [e.g., @RolfsCarrasco2012], and to the reduced latency of the 'full' PLR that we observe here. More generally, we believe that pupillometry is a powerful new tool to investigate the dynamics of peri-saccadic visual attention.

Strikingly, our results suggest that a PLR is elicited when you prepare a saccade towards a bright (or dark) stimulus, even when that stimulus is changed before being brought into central vision. More specifically, in the Swap condition (%FigMain::c), the brightness of the display reversed polarity as soon as a saccade was detected. Consequently, when preparing a saccade towards a bright target, the eyes landed on a dark target, and vice versa. Our crucial finding is that the pupil initially responded to the pre-saccadic brightness of the target. Again, this initial response occurred almost immediately after the eye movement (±19 ms after saccade offset), and is presumably entirely preparatory in nature.

Our results complement recent studies that have demonstrated various high-level effects on the PLR. Most relevant here is the recent finding that the PLR is modulated by covert visual attention [@Binda2013Bright;@Mathôt2013Plos;@Naber2013Osc]: Merely attending to a bright stimulus from the corner of your eye is sufficient to trigger a pupillary constriction. Another striking result, which dates back almost a century, but has recently been re-discovered, comes from binocular rivalry. In these studies, stimuli of different brightness are presented to each eye [@LoweOgle1966;@Fahle2011;@Naber2011;@Harms1937]. The crucial finding is that the pupil constricts when the brighter stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when the darker stimulus dominates. This shows that the PLR reflects visual awareness, rather than objective luminance. A related finding is that the pupil constricts when viewing images that are interpreted as being very bright, such as pictures of the sun, compared to equiluminant control images [@Binda2013Sun;@Naber2013Content;@LaengEndestad2012]. Finally, and perhaps most strikingly, merely thinking about a bright stimulus induces a pupillary constriction [@Laeng2014Imaginary]. Taken together, these very different studies converge on a very similar conclusion: The PLR is not just a reflexive response to light, but reflects what we (covertly) attend to, what we are aware of, how we interpret visual input, and even what we think about. Our study complements these findings by showing that the PLR is linked to saccade preparation. From a functional point of view, preparation allows the PLR to track the rapid changes in input brightness that are caused by saccadic eye movements.

In conclusion, we have shown that the pupillary light response (PLR) prepares for the brightness of stimuli before they are brought into central vision. We have suggested that this finding is linked to the pre-saccadic shift of attention [@Deubel1996Common;@Kowler1995]: The pupil prepares a light response as soon as attention shifts towards the target of an upcoming eye movement.
